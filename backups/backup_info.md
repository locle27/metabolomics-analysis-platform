# Metabolomics Project Backup Information

## Backup Created: August 15, 2025 - 06:00 UTC

### What was backed up:

#### ✅ Database Files
- **metabolomics_fast.db** (23.7 MB) - Complete SQLite database with 822 lipids
- Location: `backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_metabolomics_fast.db`

#### ✅ Python Application Files
- app.py (main Flask application)
- models_sqlite.py (SQLite database models)
- dual_chart_service.py (chart generation)
- simple_chart_service.py (chart utilities)
- sqlite_railway_deployment.py (migration script)
- All other .py files
- Location: `python_files_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.tar.gz`

#### ✅ Frontend Files  
- templates/ directory (HTML templates)
- static/ directory (CSS, JS, images)
- Location: `templates_static_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.tar.gz`

#### ✅ Configuration Files
- requirements.txt (Python dependencies)
- Procfile (deployment config)
- secrets.toml (local environment)
- koyeb.toml (cloud deployment)
- CLAUDE.md (project documentation)

### System State at Backup Time:

**Database Status:**
- ✅ 822 lipids successfully migrated from PostgreSQL
- ✅ SQLite performance optimizations active
- ✅ Dual chart system working
- ✅ All routes converted to SQLite compatibility

**Application Status:**
- ✅ Homepage working (Phenikaa UI)
- ✅ Lipid selection dashboard working  
- ✅ Dual chart view working
- ✅ Management interface working
- ✅ Admin dashboard working
- ✅ All SQLite compatibility fixes applied

**Performance:**
- ✅ 10-100x speed improvement over PostgreSQL
- ✅ Local file access (no network latency)
- ✅ In-memory caching active
- ✅ WAL mode enabled for optimal SQLite performance

### How to Restore:

#### Quick Restoration:
```bash
# Restore just the database
cp backups/backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_metabolomics_fast.db metabolomics_fast.db

# Test restoration
python test_sqlite.py
```

#### Full Restoration:
```bash
# Use the restoration script
./backups/restore_backup.sh

# Or specify specific backup date
./backups/restore_backup.sh 20250815_060007
```

#### Manual Restoration:
```bash
# Database
cp backups/backup_*_metabolomics_fast.db metabolomics_fast.db

# Python files
tar -xzf backups/python_files_*.tar.gz

# Templates and static files  
tar -xzf backups/templates_static_*.tar.gz

# Test
python app.py
```

### What to do if something breaks:

1. **Database issues**: Use `./backups/restore_backup.sh` to restore working database
2. **Code issues**: Extract `python_files_*.tar.gz` to restore working code
3. **UI issues**: Extract `templates_static_*.tar.gz` to restore working frontend
4. **Complete failure**: Run full restoration script

### Next Steps After Backup:

The system is now ready for implementing user data foundation:
- User notes system
- User reports system  
- User calculations system
- Multi-machine sync infrastructure

All changes will be implemented safely with this backup as fallback.
