# üöÖ RAILWAY DEPLOYMENT SAFETY GUIDE

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: READ BEFORE DEPLOYING

You mentioned you're afraid of errors and data conflicts. This guide ensures **ZERO DATA LOSS**.

## üõ°Ô∏è PROTECTION STRATEGY

### 1. **DATABASE BACKUP (MANDATORY FIRST STEP)**
‚úÖ You already have Railway PostgreSQL + pgAdmin4 with imported data
‚úÖ **EXPORT YOUR DATABASE NOW** before any deployment:

```sql
-- In pgAdmin4, right-click your Railway database ‚Üí Backup
-- Save as: metabolomics_railway_backup_YYYYMMDD.backup
-- Location: /backup/ folder
```

### 2. **CODE SAFETY CHECKPOINTS**
‚úÖ Backup folder created: `/backup/` contains all critical files
‚úÖ Route fix applied: `/dashboard` alias prevents template errors  
‚úÖ Logo fix applied: `static/logo-phenikaa.png` for proper display
‚úÖ Both virtual environments ready: `venv_wsl` (Linux) + `venv_linux` (Windows)

### 3. **PRE-DEPLOYMENT TESTING (MANDATORY)**

#### Local Test with Railway Database:
```bash
# Set your Railway database URL temporarily
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@host:port/database"
# Or in Windows: $env:DATABASE_URL="postgresql://..."

# Test the application
source venv_wsl/bin/activate  # or .\venv_linux\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python app.py

# Verify:
# ‚úÖ Homepage loads (/)
# ‚úÖ Dashboard works (/dashboard) 
# ‚úÖ Logo displays correctly
# ‚úÖ Database connection successful
# ‚úÖ Charts load with your imported data
```

## üöÄ SAFE DEPLOYMENT PROCESS

### Step 1: Final Local Verification
```bash
# Test everything locally first
python -c "
from app import app
with app.test_request_context():
    from flask import url_for
    print('‚úÖ Routes working:')
    print(f'Homepage: {url_for(\"homepage\")}')
    print(f'Dashboard: {url_for(\"clean_dashboard\")}')
"
```

### Step 2: Railway Configuration
In Railway dashboard, set these environment variables:
```
DATABASE_URL = [Your Railway PostgreSQL URL]
SECRET_KEY = [Generate a secure key]
FLASK_ENV = production
```

### Step 3: Deployment Files Ready
‚úÖ `railway.json` - Railway configuration
‚úÖ `runtime.txt` - Python 3.12.3
‚úÖ `Procfile` - `web: gunicorn app:app`
‚úÖ `requirements.txt` - Updated with gunicorn

### Step 4: Deploy Strategy
```bash
# Option A: Railway CLI
railway login
railway link [your-project]
railway up

# Option B: GitHub Integration (Safer)
# Push to GitHub, connect Railway to repository
# Railway will auto-deploy on push
```

## üÜò EMERGENCY RECOVERY PLAN

### If Deployment Breaks:
1. **Database**: Import backup from pgAdmin4
2. **Code**: Restore from `/backup/` folder  
3. **Routes**: Verify `/dashboard` route exists
4. **Logo**: Confirm `static/logo-phenikaa.png` path
5. **Local Test**: Always test locally before re-deploying

### Quick Restore Commands:
```bash
# Restore code from backup
cp -r backup/* .

# Test restored code
source venv_wsl/bin/activate
python app.py
```

## üéØ SUCCESS INDICATORS

After deployment, verify:
- [ ] Homepage loads with Phenikaa UI
- [ ] Logo displays correctly in header
- [ ] Dashboard (/dashboard) accessible
- [ ] Database queries return your imported lipid data
- [ ] Charts render with your data
- [ ] Navigation works across all tabs

## üö® RED FLAGS - STOP DEPLOYMENT IF:
- ‚ùå Local testing fails
- ‚ùå Database connection errors
- ‚ùå Missing routes (dashboard, homepage)
- ‚ùå Logo not displaying
- ‚ùå Template errors

## üìû EMERGENCY CONTACT

If deployment fails:
1. **DON'T PANIC** - Your data is backed up
2. Use backup folder to restore working state
3. Test locally until everything works
4. Only then retry Railway deployment

**Remember: Railway won't touch your database data - only the application code changes.**

---

‚úÖ **Your data is SAFE because:**
- Database backup exists in pgAdmin4
- Complete code backup in `/backup/` folder  
- Local testing verifies everything before deployment
- Railway deployment is code-only (data preserved)
